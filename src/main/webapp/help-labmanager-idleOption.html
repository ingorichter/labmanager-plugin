    Set the policy for what to do to the Virtual Machine once it has been
    determined to be idle.  The choices are to perform a Shutdown, a Shutdown
    and Revert, a Suspend or Undeploy.  The shutdown action will attempt to perform a
    clean shutdown of the OS.  The Shutdown and Revert option will perform a
    clean shutdown (which is needed in certain cases to ensure <i>Jenkins</i>
    sees the slave go away) and will then restore the Virtual Machine to its
    last revert point.  This revert point (called a snapshot in Lab Manager
    terminology) must be created outside of <i>Jenkins</i>.
    Undeploy will <b>shutdown and undeploy</b> the machine. Using this option where a
    low deployment lease is configured. Once all machines of a configuration
    have been undeployed, the configuration gets undeployed too. The next time
    a machine is requested from this configuration, the configuration and the machines
    are getting deployed.

    It is recommended to perform a Shutdown on the Virtual Machine rather than
    a Suspend.  Suspend should only be used when it is not possible or is
    ill-advised to have the Virtual Machine be shutdown.
